# Static Web Hosting On Amazon S3 Bucket

Creating a static website using an [Amazon S3 Bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Welcome.html?nc2=type_a) is a powerful and cost-effective solution. Here’s a simple architecture overview and then a step-by-step implementation guide.

The prerequisite is to create an AWS account if you don't have one. If you do, then you will have to [log in](https://aws.amazon.com/).

Step 1:
Navigate to the Amazon S3 Service. To do this, [log in](https://aws.amazon.com/) to the AWS Management Console.
In the search bar, type “S3” and select it.
